# Simplified PDF Generation

## Changes Made

The PDF generation process has been simplified to focus on the core functionality: placing images in the correct order in a PDF file. Here are the key changes:

### 1. Simplified PDF Creator

Created a new module `simplified_creator.py` that:
- Takes a list of image paths and places them in order in the PDF
- Scales images to fit properly on each page
- Uses landscape orientation for better viewing
- Removes complex formatting, text embedding, and other unnecessary features

### 2. Template Filter for Path Handling

Added a `basename` filter to Flask to simplify path handling in templates:
```python
@app.template_filter('basename')
def basename_filter(path):
    return os.path.basename(path) if path else ''
```

### 3. Simplified Storybook HTML Template

Updated the storybook.html template to:
- Display images in a simple grid layout
- Use proper path handling with os.path.basename()
- Add simple captions for illustration and text images

### 4. Added OS Module to Template Context

Made the `os` module available in templates for path handling:
```python
return render_template('storybook.html', 
                      session_id=session_id,
                      data=session_data,
                      os=os)  # Add os module to template context
```

## How It Works Now

1. Images are generated as before
2. When creating a PDF, the system:
   - Takes all the image paths
   - Places them in order in the PDF, one per page
   - No complex layout or formatting is applied
   - Images are scaled to fit properly on the page
   - A simple PDF is created with just the images

## Benefits

- Simpler code that's easier to maintain
- Fewer points of failure
- Faster PDF generation
- No Jinja2 template errors
- Focus on the core functionality (displaying images in order)

## Using the Simplified PDF Generation

The system now uses the simplified PDF generator by default. No changes are needed to your workflow:

1. Generate story and images as usual
2. Click "Create PDF" to generate the PDF with the images in order
3. Download and view the PDF

All the complexity has been removed from the PDF generation process, making it more reliable and focused on the essential functionality.
