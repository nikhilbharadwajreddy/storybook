Create a high-quality children's book illustration depicting this exact scene: {prompt_text}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: I have UPLOADED a reference image showing what {child_name} looks like - you MUST use the UPLOADED image to accurately depict {child_name} in this illustration.

Follow these specific requirements:
- The UPLOADED reference image shows what {child_name} looks like - maintain EXACT same appearance (face, hair, clothing style, etc.)
- Use the UPLOADED image as your direct reference for {child_name}'s appearance
- Create the illustration in PORTRAIT ORIENTATION (taller than wide, dimensions: 1024x1536 pixels)
- Position {child_name} prominently in the scene, with the SAME physical appearance as in the UPLOADED reference image
- Create a complete, detailed scene that shows the exact action described in the prompt
- Include a rich, detailed background environment that complements the main action
- Use bright, saturated colors with strong contrast to create visual interest

CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:
- {child_name} MUST look EXACTLY like the child in the UPLOADED reference image (same face, hair, skin tone, clothing style)
- The image MUST be in PORTRAIT ORIENTATION (width: 1024px, height: 1536px)
- Do NOT change the child's appearance, age, or features - use the UPLOADED reference as a direct model

The UPLOADED reference image contains the actual appearance of {child_name} that must be matched exactly in this illustration.
